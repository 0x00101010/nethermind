Networks
********

By default Nethermind launches with mainnet network configuration but you can sync any of the below networks by adding a command line switch::

    --config name_of_the_network

Network name can be any of the following

* mainnet
* rinkeby
* goerli
* ropsten
* stureby

Mainnet
^^^^^^^

This is the main public Ethereum network secured by the ethash PoW algorithm.

::

    Nethermind.Runner --config mainnet

GÃ¶rli (goerli)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a Clique-PoA based testnet supported by all major clients. It has a 15 seconds delay between blocks that are sealed by Goerli validators.

::

    Nethermind.Runner --config goerli

Ropsten
^^^^^^^

This is a test network secured by ethash PoW algorithm which resembles mainnet most closely but is prone to hashrate-based attacks.

::

    Nethermind.Runner --config ropsten

Rinkeby
^^^^^^^

This is a Clique-PoA based testnet supported by Geth and Nethermind. It has a 15 seconds delay between blocks.

::

    Nethermind.Runner --config rinkeby


Stureby
^^^^^^^

This is a PoW-based testnet introduced to rapidly test all the transitions between different Ethereum releases - first 50000 blocks include transitions from Frontier all the way to Constantinople.

::

    Nethermind.Runner --config stureby


Kovan
^^^^^

This is an Aura-PoA based testnet supported by Parity only.
