We have incorporated Int128 and UInt128 classes from Dirichlet.Numerics by Rick Sladkey to build Int256.
One can expect significant changes to the original source code and go to Rick Sladkey's project github
at https://github.com/ricksladkey/dirichlet-numerics/blob/master/license.txt for original code reference.
